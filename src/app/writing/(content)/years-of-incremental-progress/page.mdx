The companies which look like they have revolutionalised the industry, the ones which "chaged how we did X before", are mearly regular companies which iteratively and incrementally build upon their product, toiling on for years before they "make it".

What looks like an "overnight success" when you look in hindsight, has tons of years of thought and effort behind it.
