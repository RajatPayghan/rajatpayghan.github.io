<Letter text="Dear Josh (And The Browser Company),

I feel betrayed.

I really wish I could say that this statement is an exaggeration. Maybe the whining of a petulant kid. Or a silent tantrum of a dramatic 6 yr old me when my favorite toy broke.

But its not.

Arc has been a constant companion throughout my four years as a CS Undergrad. I have designed great apps in it, developed beautiful websites and managed people & products with it. It has been my own locker of tabs, organized by spaces and decorated by boosts. A crazy, messy place of joy.

But now you've pivoted away from the place you call 'your home on the internet' . I read your Letter to Arc members ,2025. And let me just say, I felt let down. how easily you walked away from Arc, a software loved by everyone who experiences it."/>

# Hold up Rajat, but what is Arc

\*dramatic flare of hands\* Glad you asked!

Arc is a browser.......

Hold on, you were expecting something more, weren’t you ? Judging by my ol' dramatic enactment of woe, you might be think I lost something life changing, something out of this world.

Let me tell you, Arc truly _was_ out of this world. In its own unique way, it kind of was.

It did one thing exceptionally well—it made my experience navigating the internet a little bit easier. Well, make that a lot easier. I don't wanna bore you will the details, so here's a good analogy.

In cartoon world, there is the concept of [_hammer space_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerspace), an imaginary extradimensional, instantly accessible storage area with everything you might need to get out of any situation. The magic of hammerspace is that you simply reach in, and the perfect tool for the moment appears in your hand, ready to help you.

Arc was my _hammer space_. In a more realistic example for 2000's Indian kids watching cartoons, Arc is my _Doraemon's Pocket_. It organized every single thing I would ever need from the internet, ready at my fingertips.

So, yeah, you might say I was quite attached to this simple browser.

# So what really happened ?

As all montages go, let's start, from the very beginning.

According to _The Browser Company_, they built Arc because "the browser is the most important software in your life — and it wasn’t getting the attention it deserved". And after its launch, the humble browser did get its well deserved long pending attention.

Never in a million years, ever since I first touched internet explorer on my windows vista, did I imagine the browser having a fan following.

The OS ? Sure.

A weird digital paperclip which gives unsolicited advice ? Maybe.

A tool whose sole purpose is to be a window to the internet ? Never

And yet, here in 2025, we have an ardent fan following of Arc, a simple browser. It's not the most popular, nor the most used, nor the fastest. Its not ultra secure like brave, anonymous like onion, default like chrome, efficient like safari. Its not even the lightest.

But, its arguably the most feature rich. You can automatically organize tabs in folders and subfolders, create spaces and profiles with custom logins, customize it, make it your own.

It was going on great. Arc was gaining more customers every day. Brand loyalty was at par with Apple. People were willing to pay to use a browser.

And then, one fine day, they decide to pivot to build a generic LLM wrapper search browser. Like perplexity. Like gemini. Like every other generic "AI Search" bullshit vapid startup which in the end is a LLM wrapper.

Has The Browser Company become one of them, I wonder ?

But I want to give them the benefit of doubt. I really do. The Browser Company has one of the best UI/UX teams the world has seen. It also has a dope engineering team which has proven to ship crazy updated every Thursday. Those good old Arc days.

> In the article, Josh says that Arc has a novelty problem, is slow, bloated and not "mass-market worthy".

To these concerns, let me put my two cents in.

Well, is it Novel ? Yes. Is that a bad thing ? No. There are many niche & novel companies, with a great product and a sustainable revenue model. You could completely dominate the space you live in.

Is it slow, bloated ? Yes. Does it need a fresh new start ? Maybe, yes. But don't create a completely new browser, with no assurances or guarantee of interoperability with Arc.

At this point I don't know if Dia would be "soo radically different" that I cant switch to it completely from Arc. I dont know if the features I love from Arc would still be there in it. And honestly, what's stopping you from just ditching Dia when the next shiny browser thing comes along?
