<Letter text="Dear Josh (And The Browser Company),

I feel betrayed.

I really wish I could say that this statement is an exaggeration. Maybe the whining of a petulant kid. Or a silent tantrum of a dramatic 6 yr old me when my favorite toy broke.

But its not.

Arc has been a constant companion throughout my four years as a CS Undergrad. I have designed great apps in it, developed beautiful websites and managed people & products with it. It has been my own locker of tabs, organized by spaces and decorated by boosts. A crazy, messy place of joy.

But now you've pivoted away from the place you call 'your home on the internet' . I read your Letter to Arc members ,2025. And let me just say, I felt let down. how easily you walked away from Arc, a software loved by everyone who experiences it."/>

# Hold up Rajat, but what is Arc

\*dramatic flare of hands\* Glad you asked!

Arc is a browser.......

Hold on, you were expecting something more, werenâ€™t you ? Judging by my ol' dramatic enactment of woe, you might be think I lost something life changing, something out of this world.

Let me tell you, Arc truly _was_ out of this world. In its own unique way, it kind of was.

It did one thing exceptionally wellâ€”it made my experience navigating the internet a little bit easier. Well, make that a lot easier. I don't wanna bore you will the details, so here's a good analogy.

In cartoon world, there is the concept of [_hammer space_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerspace), an imaginary extradimensional, instantly accessible storage area with everything you might need to get out of any situation. The magic of hammerspace is that you simply reach in, and the perfect tool for the moment appears in your hand, ready to help you.

Arc was my _hammer space_. In a more realistic example for 2000's Indian kids watching cartoons, Arc is my _Doraemon's Pocket_. It organized every single thing I would ever need from the internet, ready at my fingertips.

So, yeah, you might say I was quite attached to this simple browser.

# So what really happened ?

As all montages go, let's start, from the very beginning.

According to _The Browser Company_, they built Arc because "the browser is the most important software in your life â€” and it wasnâ€™t getting the attention it deserved". And after its launch, the humble browser did get its well deserved long pending attention.

Never in a million years, ever since I first touched internet explorer on my windows vista, did I imagine the browser having a fan following.

The OS ? Sure.

A weird digital paperclip which gives unsolicited advice ? Maybe.

A tool whose sole purpose is to be a window to the internet ? Never

And yet, here in 2025, we have an ardent fan following of Arc, a simple browser. It's not the most popular, nor the most used, nor the fastest. Its not ultra secure like brave, anonymous like onion, default like chrome, efficient like safari. Its not even the lightest.

But it's arguably the most feature-rich. You can automatically organize tabs in folders and subfolders, create spaces and profiles with custom logins, customize it, and make it your own. It was going great.

Arc was gaining more customers every day. Brand loyalty was on par with Apple. People were willing to pay to use a browser.

And then, one fine day, they decided to pivot to build a generic LLM wrapper search browser. Like Perplexity. Like Gemini. Like every other generic "AI Search" bullshit vapid startup which, in the end, is just an LLM wrapper.

Has The Browser Company become one of them, I wonder ?

But you know what, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt. I really do. The Browser Company has one of the best UI/UX teams the world has seen. It also has a solid engineering team that has proven it can ship crazy updates every Thursday. Those good old Arc days.

> In the article, Josh says that Arc has a novelty problem, is slow, bloated and not "mass-market worthy".

To these concerns, let me put my two cents in.

Well, is it novel? Yes. Is that a bad thing? No. There are many niche & novel companies with great products and sustainable revenue models. You could completely dominate the space you live in.

Is it slow and bloated? Yes. Does it need a fresh new start? Maybe, yes. But don't create a completely new browser with no assurances or guarantee of interoperability with Arc.

At this point, I don't know if Dia would be "so radically different" that I can't switch to it completely from Arc. I don't know if the features I love from Arc would still be there. And honestly, what's stopping you from just ditching Dia when the next shiny browser thing comes along?

# So whats up with Dia ?

Dia is an AI browser with somewhat meh capabilities. At least for now. It's still in alpha testing, with the testers being predominantly college students, some YouTubers, and some Arc users. I have applied for Dia and haven't yet received an invite.

<BlogImage src={ImageDiaInvite} alt='Applied for Dia, the colours are ðŸ’– tho' />

Just to give some more context, Dia is essentially a next-gen barebones AI-equipped browser for the masses. Built from the ground up on the SDK that built Arc. It aims to shed the baggage of bloatware that plagued Arc, with most of the "unused" features being taken out.

Speaking of features being taken out, here is an extract about the same from the original article by TBC

Only 5.52% of DAUs use more than one Space regularly. Only 4.17% use Live Folders (including GitHub Live Folders). It's 0.4% for one of our favorite features, Calendar Preview on Hover.

Wow. Out of millions of users, only about 5.5% use Spaces. But, out of maybe a couple thousand alpha testers, those testers who are specifically here to test out the only feature in Dia namely AI tabs, only 40% of the users use the feature.

Wow.

Wake up, The Browser Company.

All I can say is chase better metrics.

Have guardrails and counter metrics.

And, as Josh rightfully mentioned in his [recent video with MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzF7S8zc1IQ), communicate better. Not like a salesman, like you have been doing recently. But like the avid internet admirer we loved during the early days of arc.
