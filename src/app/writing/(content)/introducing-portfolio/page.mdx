Look Mom â€“ I made my own website!

And honestly, it took me soo long. Way longer than I expected. The idea started as a simple portfolio in 2023 when I began freelancing as a Digital Product Designer. I wanted to showcase my work online (mostly because every freelance designer I looked up to had one), so I tried Webflow (too complicated), then Framer (when I co-founded studio.pixellum). But that didn't work out. Then university and internships put this project on hold.

# The start of something code

In September 2024, I decided to can the lure of 'website builders', and started developing my website in next.js and react. I had some familiarity with the stack, and with just a sprinkle of simple sections, my first website version V1 came into existance.

  <BlogImage src={WebsiteV1Image} alt='Version 1 of my website, Oct 2024' />
</MediaContainer>

Fun fact, the small robot is an interactive spline element. Feel free to mess around with it

<MediaContainer>
  <SplineHome
    sceneLink={'https://prod.spline.design/MWg7T9pvG4cTrW9r/scene.splinecode'}
    className='w-full'
  />
</MediaContainer>

Then soon, in Feb 2024, I got some free time in my hands, and added support for dark mode, changed the overall feel of the website and added a cool image shader for my profile photo.
