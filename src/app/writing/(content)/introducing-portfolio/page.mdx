Look Mom, I made my own website!

And honestly, it took me way longer than expected. The idea started simple enough in 2023 when I began freelancing as a Digital Product Designer. I wanted to showcase my work online (mostly because every freelance designer I looked up to had one), so I tried the usual suspects: Webflow (too complicated), then Framer (when I co-founded studio.pixellum). But that didn't work out. University and internships ended up putting this whole project on the back burner.

# The start of something code

In September 2024, I decided to ditch the lure of 'website builders' and started developing my website in Next.js and React. I had some familiarity with the stack, and with just a sprinkle of simple sections, my first website version V1 came into existence.

Fun fact: The small robot is an interactive spline element. Feel free to mess around with it

Then in March 2025, I got some free time on my hands and added support for dark mode, changing the overall feel of the website, and added a cool image profile image front and centre. That felt....a bit too front and centre. For me, atleast.

Cut to June 2024—I completely revamped the [Homepage](/), added the [Writing](/writing) section to document my life (?) and just post any random thoughts, experiences, and media I come across. This website has been really fun to code, just exploring animations and looking at different pages for inspiration.

# On the shoulders of giants

Creating a website from scratch is not an easy process. Hell, design itself is not a walk in the park. You need patience, the correct mindset, and inspiration.

True design is always inspired.

By nature.

By people.

By experiences.

And most of the time, by other similar products around us.

So naturally, I dove deep into research, looking for inspiration from various personal websites. At that point I had already pivoted from creating a portfolio site, and my search led me to many developers and their personal sites. These people inspired me to ditch all of the noise and focus on what actually matters—the content and the experience of sharing it.

After looking at some crazy circus-y animated portfolio websites on [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/), I realized I wanted something simple, and I daresay, minimal. This would help me showcase more of what I am and not what the latest animation library can do. I didn't want to get lost in the design details that don't have any meaning. They don't actually get you to finishing the goal you set out to complete in the first place.

In this search, I discovered [DeadSimpleSites](https://deadsimplesites.com/). Bingo! Through this site, I found many personal websites that stood on the shoulders of those I admire in the field.

Visually, my site became a remix of many minimal sites I find stunning, but primararily the ones from [Paco Coursey](https://paco.me/), [Jia](https://jrhu.me/) and [Gaddafi Rusli](https://gaddafirusli.my/). The writing section was inspired from [Dominik Hofer](https://dominikhofer.me/), whose blog I absolutely love.

These sites taught me to favor an approach of simplicity, which strips away all the excuses one could make, and actually showcase what really matters.

Now that I'm somewhat "done" (we all know websites are never really finished), I'm hoping to use this space to share more about my process, the things that catch my attention, and maybe some of the lessons learned along the way. I've been on the receiving end of so many generous people taking the time to document their work and insights. Hopefully I can give back a bit where I can.

One more thing, if you see a design idea you like from my exploration, feel free go ahead and steal it! Or just [Reach Out](mailto:rajat.payghan@gmail.com) if you wanna bounce ideas. That's how the web grows and evolves; through shared inspiration and honest remixing.

# What's Next, Rajat ?

Damn, tough question. Once you get used to building something creative on your own, it's really hard to stop. The ideas just keep coming, you know? I've got loads rattling around in my head—from something as simple as a `/uses` page to more ambitious stuff like collaborative realtime comments or chat features. But obviously, that's probably aeons away.

Or not.

Anyways, for now, since the core aspects of my website are done, I'm thinking I'll probably tackle a `/photo-feed` or a `/now` page next. I mean, having unlimited creative freedom means I can basically build whatever catches my interest.

A personal website can become anything, and that's both exciting and overwhelming.

I would highly recommend you to build your own soon. Take this as your sign from the universe, I guess. Start small. Maybe a website builder, or wordpress. Maybe your nephew can cook something up on that newfangled thing he calls VisionPro. Ask ChatGPT. Or go crazy with huge tech stacks capable of building collective universal conciousness. Your call.

But just start building.

Will update this section once something actually gets built instead of just living in my head.

# <span id='tech-stack'>Tech Stack for Nerds </span>

Now the fun(?) part. The ingredients of my recipie

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for easy styling
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) Markdown in JSX
  - I am also a long time user of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), so I was already well versed in the [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format
- [Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for some minimal motion interactions. Mainly for inView and onLoad transitions
- [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for the colours and initial setup. Also some components along the way.

## Finally,

The site is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/RajatPayghan/rajatpayghan.github.io), feel free to check it out and reach out if you have any questions about it.
